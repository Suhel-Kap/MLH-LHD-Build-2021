# Weather Web App for MLH Local Hack Day : Build 2021

This is a simple weather app that uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the current weather for a city.

This web app is built using HTML, Bootstrap, and Python.

When you run the app, you will see a form with a text input for the city name.

When you submit the form, the app will get the weather for the city and display it in the browser.

You can check out the app [here](https://mlh-local-hack-day.github.io/weather-app/).
